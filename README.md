# Rentagram
Rentagram is the web platform of a car rental service: the user can check out news, browse available cars, and manage its own rentals.

This is an academic project for "Web Applications I" exam, therefore the project is mainly written in javascript and the technologies used are React.js, bootstrap and relevant javascript libraries (moment.js).

The original project included also a node.js back-end (Express), therefore it was adapted to be deployed on GitHub pages, by mocking back-end services.
