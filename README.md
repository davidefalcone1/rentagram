# rentagram
Rentagram is the web portal of an immaginary Car rental shop: the user can check out news, browse available cars, and manage its own rentals.
This is an academic project for "Web Applications I" exam, therefore technologies used are the javascript programming language, React.js, relevant javascript libraries (moment.js) and HTML/CSS.
The original project included also a node.js back-end (Express), therefore it was adapted to be deployed on GitHub pages, by mocking back-end services.
